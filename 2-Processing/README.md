These are the scripts developed for post processing the data after collection with the modified OpenAddresses pipeline. In most cases, the Python scripts process a single source, and there is therefore also a Python notebook to build a shell script to automate running the code for every source.
All the sources used, and the date they were downloaded, is stored in the valid sources excel sheet.
